# SmartCatalogSPL

My graduation conclusion work

Abstract:
Software Product Lines (SPLs) consist of a large scale form of software reuse. Instead ofdeveloping single software products reusing components in an ad hoc way, in an SPL ap-proach, a family of products is addressed. A common set of software assets is built, whichallows derivation of different products in a prescribed way.  In this work, we exploit thispromising approach to develop an SPL of product catalogues, namely Smart Catalog, tar-geting mobile devices using the Android platform.  We adopt an extractive and reactiveapproach.  That is, we consider a previously developed application and extract an SPLbased on it.  Then, we incorporate new features based on new products we aim to derivefrom this SPL. As result, we report the challenges and benefits identified in our work, aswell as lessons learned.
